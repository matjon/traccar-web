        <h3>YUI library (The Yahoo! User Interface Library)</h3>
        <p>(Used by ExtJS)</p>
        <p>Original notice in the <code>./LICENSE</code> file in <code>ext-6.2.0-gpl.zip</code>:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>Library: YUI 0.6 - drag-and-drop code
License: BSD
Location: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui</code></pre></blockquote>
        <p>According to notices in source code, several classes are based on code copied from the YUI library, most of which are concerned with drag-and-drop functionality. </p>

        <p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the following classes are based on YUI:</p>
        <ul>
                <li><code>Ext.dd.DragDropManager</code> (defined in <code>DragDropManager.js</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Ext.dd.DragDrop</code>        (defined in <code>DragDrop.js</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Ext.dd.DD</code>              (defined in <code>DD.js</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Ext.dd.DDProxy</code>         (defined in <code>DDProxy.js</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Ext.dd.DDTarget</code>        (defined in <code>DDTarget.js</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These classes can be found in the <code>./classic/classic/src/dd/</code> directory in ExtJS sources and have the following notice in their header:<p>
<blockquote><pre><code>/*
 * This is a derivative of the similarly named class in the YUI Library.
 * The original license:
 * Copyright (c) 2006, Yahoo! Inc. All rights reserved.
 * Code licensed under the BSD License:
 * http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/license.txt
 */</code></pre></blockquote>

        <p><strong>Secondly</strong>, there is a notice in class <code>Ext.env.Ready</code> (defined in <code>packages/core/src/env/Ready.js</code>) that some code has been copied from YUI: </p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>licensed courtesy of http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html</code></pre></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, YUI is mentioned also in class <code>Ext.event.Event</code> (file <code>classic/classic/overrides/event/Event.js</code>). Maybe something was copied there, maybe not.</p>

        <p><strong>Additionally</strong>, a notice in the file <code>examples/classic/app/nested-loading/resources/json/products.json</code> (search for "YUI" there) suggest that early versions of the ExtJS library may have been just extended versions of YUI. So maybe some more ideas were copied from YUI.</p>
        <p><strong>What's more</strong>, there are several additional mentions of YUI TODO finish this</p>

        <p>The ancient version of the YUI library is (fortunately) not necessary for compiling ExtJS.</p>

        <h3>jQuery Sparklines - sparkline.js</h3>
        <p>(Used by ExtJS)</p>
        <p>There are several classes in ExtJS that have "sparkline" in their name, maybe it was these classes that were based on <code>sparkline.js</code>. These classes are:</p>
        <ul>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.Bar</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.BarBase</code></li>

                <li><code>Ext.override.sparkline.Base</code> (defined in <code>classic/classic/overrides/sparkline/Base.js</code> and <code>modern/modern/overrides/sparkline/Base.js</code>)</li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.Box</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.Bullet</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.CanvasBase</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.CanvasCanvas</code></li>

                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.Pie</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.RangeMap</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.Shape</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.TriState</code></li>
                <li><code>Ext.sparkline.VmlCanvas</code></li>
                <!-- TODO: check if this list is exhaustive. -->
        </ul>
        <p>These classes are defined inside directory <code>packages/core/src/sparkline</code> unless otherwise noted. It is unclear which version of sparkline they may be based on.</p>

Other packages used by Sencha:

I browsed through most of ext-6.2.0-gpl.zip and didn't find anything more interesting. Didn't look into the examples folder though.

TODO: search build/ext-all-debug.js for strings like "http", "license", etc.

                - this is more interesting,

                packages/font-awesome/resources/fonts
                        IMPORTANT
                        - this contains binary files of Font Awesome,
                        - shouldn't be sources there?

        packages/font-ext
                ExtJS.eot  ExtJS.svg  ExtJS.ttf  ExtJS.woff

                IMPORTANT
                        - no source code located (?),
